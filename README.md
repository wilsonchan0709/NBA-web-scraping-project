# NBA-web-scraping-project

Th object of this project is to scrape gaming statistics (traditional splits) for all NBA players from official NBA website. Only the statistics from the team which the player currently playing in can be extracted by the Python script. I.e. It doesn't scrape data for Heats played by Lerbon James as he's playing in Cavaliers. 

Remarks:
- Apart from Python and its packages, ChromeDriver installation in your machine is required.
